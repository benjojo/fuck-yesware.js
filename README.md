fuck-yesware.js

A [google app script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) that will allow you to detect [YesWare](http://archive.is/j9mn4) infected emails and mark them as unread, and warn you about them by adding a tag on the email.

Yesware annoys the shit out of me, and is a incredibly good sign that I don't want to read the email ( sales, or very crap recuritment attempts )

You can find install instructions on my other app scripts repo: https://github.com/benjojo/Gmail_GeoIPTagger
